        <h2>Front-end Developemnt Technologies</h2>
        <dt>HTML</dt>
        <dd>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design the front end portion of web pages using markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language.

        <h3>Front End Libraries and Frameworks</h3>
        <dt>AngularJS</dt>
        <dd>AngularJs is a JavaScript open source front-end framework that is mainly used to develop single page web applications(SPAs). It is a continuously growing and expanding framework which provides better ways for developing web applications. It changes the static HTML to dynamic HTML. It is an open source project which can be freely used and changed by anyone. It extends HTML attributes with Directives, and data is bound with HTML.</dd>
        <dt>React.js</dt>
        <dd>React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. ReactJS is an open-source, component-based front end library responsible only for the view layer of the application. It is maintained by Facebook.</dd>
        <dt>Bootstrap</dt>
        <dd>Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications. It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first web sites.</dd>
        <dt>jQuery</dt>
        <dd>jQuery is an open source JavaScript library that simplifies the interactions between an HTML/CSS document, or more precisely the Document Object Model (DOM), and JavaScript. Elaborating the terms, jQuery simplifies HTML document traversing and manipulation, browser event handling, DOM animations, Ajax interactions, and cross-browser JavaScript development.</dd>
        <dt>SASS</dt>
        <dd>It is the most reliable, mature and robust CSS extension language. It is used to extend the functionality of an existing CSS of a site including everything from variables, inheritance, and nesting with ease.</dd>
        <h2>Back-end Developemnt Technologies</h2>
        <dt>Node.js</dt>
        <dd>Node.js is an open source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. You need to remember that NodeJS is not a framework and it’s not a programming language. Most of the people are confused and understand it’s a framework or a programming language. We often use Node.js for building back-end services like APIs like Web App or Mobile App. It’s used in production by large companies such as Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart and so on.</dd>
        <dt>Python</dt>
        <dd>Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.</dd>
        <dt>Java</dt>
        <dd>Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming language and platform. It is highly scalable. Java components are easily available.</dd>
        <dt>PHP</dt>
        <dd>PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. Since, PHP code executed on server side so it is called server side scripting language.</dd>
        <h3>Back End Libraries and Frameworks</h3>
        <dt>Express</dt>
        <dd>Express.js is a small framework that works on top of Node.js web server functionality to simplify its APIs and add helpful new features. It makes it easier to organize your application’s functionality with middleware and routing. It adds helpful utilities to Node.js HTTP objects and facilitates the rendering of dynamic HTTP objects.</dd>
        <dt>Django</dt>
        <dd>Django is a Python-based web framework that allows you to quickly create efficient web applications. It is also called batteries included framework because Django provides built-in features for everything including Django Admin Interface, default database – SQLlite3, etc. When you’re building a website, you always need a similar set of components: a way to handle user authentication (signing up, signing in, signing out), a management panel for your website, forms, a way to upload files, etc. Django gives you ready-made components to use and that too for rapid development.</dd>
        <dt>Spring</dt>
        <dd>The Spring framework which is commonly known as Spring has emerged as a solution to all these complications This framework uses various new techniques such as Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), Plain Old Java Object (POJO), and dependency injection (DI), to develop enterprise applications, thereby removing the complexities involved while developing enterprise applications using EJB, Spring is an open source lightweight framework that allows Java EE 7 developers to build simple, reliable, and scalable enterprise applications. This framework mainly focuses on providing various ways to help you manage your business objects. </dd>
        <h2>Database</h2>
        <dt>MongoDB</dt>
        <dd>MongoDB, the most popular NoSQL database, is an open source document-oriented database. The term ‘NoSQL’ means ‘non-relational’. It means that MongoDB isn’t based on the table-like relational database structure but provides an altogether different mechanism for storage and retrieval of data.</dd>
        <dt>Oracle</dt>
        <dd>Oracle database is the collection of data which is treated as a unit. The purpose of this database is to store and retrieve information related to the query. It is a database server and used to manages information.</dd>
        <dt>SQL</dt>
